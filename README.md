# Fullstack Coding House

### Intro
This application is a platform that allows users to work together on coding projects in real-time. This means that multiple users can make changes to the same codebase at the same time and see each other's updates in real-time, without having to wait for someone to finish their work and send it to the others. This can be useful for situations where multiple people need to work on the same project simultaneously, or when someone needs help with a problem and needs to get input from someone else.

In addition to real-time collaboration on coding projects, this application also provides communication features such as text or voice call. This allows users to communicate with each other while they are working on the project, which can be helpful for discussing ideas, asking for help, or clarifying certain aspects of the project.

Finally, the application also allows users to create public or private rooms. Public rooms are open to anyone who has access to the application, while private rooms are only accessible to a specific group of users that the room creator invites. This can be useful for situations where users want to work on a project with a specific group of people and want to keep the project private from everyone else.
